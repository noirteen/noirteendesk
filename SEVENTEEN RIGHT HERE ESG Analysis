This Excel file contains an educational analysis of estimated environmental impacts (CO₂ emissions) for concert events. It is structured into several sections:

1. Raw_Data
Columns: Event_Date, City, Country, Venue, Venue_Capacity, Estimated_Attendance, Attendance_Rate, Region  
Contains the original event data used for analysis. The data was extracted from public information available.

2. Assumptions
Section A: Attendance Assumptions – Attendance_Rate represents % of venue capacity for each concert date.  
Section B: Emissions Factors – Estimated emission factors (kg CO₂ per attendee) for audience travel and venue energy use.  
Section C: Notes and Limitations – All emissions are simplified estimates for educational purposes and are not audited ESG data.

3. Clean_Data
Columns: Event_Date, City, Venue, Estimated_Attendance, Travel_Emission_kg, Energy_Emission_kg, Total_Emission_kg, Emission_per_Attendee_kg, Region  
Processed data ready for analysis.

4. Analysis
Insights and summary charts derived from Clean_Data to estimate overall emissions and patterns by region.
